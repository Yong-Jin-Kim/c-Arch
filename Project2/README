there are few things to consider in this project

I tried to implement both data and branch hazard detection

it turns out that there should be 3 instructions between load instruction and ALU instruction of load-use hazard

i'm not really sure about this, but i guess that this is maybe because of using newState and state.

also i want to question on the Project because if we initiallize all cycles, pcs, regs and instruction fields, we cannot have the same Output as 9.
